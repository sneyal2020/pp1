        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, I'm Snehal Shinde, a recent graduate and aspiring web developer with a focus on frontend development. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from SPPU University with a notable CGPA of 8.71. Prior to that, in 2020, I achieved a solid score of 83.15% in my diploma in Computer Engineering, and I completed my SSC with a commendable 76.80%.
            <br><br>
            In the realm of web development, I possess proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Python programming. My approach is characterized by creativity, effective teamwork, collaboration, strong communication, and adept presentation skills.
            <br><br>
            Outside of coding, I find joy in various hobbies, including playing badminton, crooning, and exploring new places through travel and trekking. These activities not only provide a balance to my technical pursuits but also contribute to my overall creativity and problem-solving abilities.
            <br><br>
            During my academic journey, I worked on two noteworthy projects:
            <br><br>
            1. <b>"Abnormal Activity Detection on Social Media (2022-2023)"</b>: In this project, I developed a system that provides a detection feature, making it more efficient and flexible for users to identify abnormal activities like harassment, abusive language, and offensive content commonly found in tweets. I implemented cutting-edge technologies to enhance the system's accuracy, overcoming challenges and achieving successful outcomes.
            <br><br>
            2.<b>"Wi-Fi Router Controller (IOT) (2019-2020)"</b>: In this project, I developed a system that enables remote access through an Android application to control Wi-Fi routers. Users can manually switch the router on and off using an RFID module, adding an extra layer of security and convenience.
            <br><br>
            Looking ahead, my professional goals include contributing my skills to innovative projects, collaborating with diverse teams, and continually expanding my expertise in web development. I am committed to ongoing learning and development, staying abreast of emerging technologies and industry trends to ensure that my skills remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving field.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for considering my profile. I'm excited about the prospect of applying my knowledge and skills in a dynamic professional setting.
